            <h5>Media: Jumpstart Ad Flow and Catalog</h5>

                    In 2011 and 2012, I was in charge of managing Jumpstart's advertiser product across 13 different publisher sites. The automotive media vertical is extremely competitive with a handful of sites representing the bulk of in-market ad spend from each mamnufacturer. Ad flow changes aren't taken lightly as even minor drops in performance can be met with disasterous concequences during upfront season. This also causes the in-market space to remain incredibly conservative with their ad product offerings.<br/>
                    During the latter half of 2011, I assembled a cross-functional team to make adjustments in time for 2012 upfront presentations. We launched new ad unit sizes, updated CSS across all 13 sites, created new documentation and an interactive product catalog; all while seeing and average 20% increase in performance across all OEM advertisers.

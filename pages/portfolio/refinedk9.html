            <h5>The Refined K-9 Brand</h5>
            <article class="smallFontBy08">
                <p>
                    Refined K-9 is a small dog training company in San Francisco that specializes in rehabilitating dogs with extreme behavioral issues. The current brand identity is something that I created from scratch. I've focused the brand around the owner, Theo Brassard, who's skill set and image are unique among dog trainers in the bay area. The brand attributes are consistent with her own personality and approach to training.<br/>
                    In addition to the website, I've designed and executed business cards, newsletters, POS collateral for local pet stores as well as worked with Theo to develop a content strategy and her own voice. I've created a CRM and marketing automation system for tracking and messaging to current and potential clients. I've also executed media campaigns across multiple platforms while tracking attribution all available through centralized dashboards. The company has seen a 200% increase in revenue in 2013.

                    Back in 2011, every traditional magazine brand was working feverishly on their "tablet strategy." Most publishers were rushing to set up corporate contracts with third party technology companies who promised to repurpose their magazine layouts for iPad. This left most iPad readers with a single orientation and no interactive functionality; a far cry from the original intentions of this magical device.<br/>
                    At Car and Driver, we worked for 6 months to find a promising compromise between integration with current print design processes while still deliverying an experience appropriate for the device. We evaluated multiple companies, services, plugins and theories on tablet design. We ultimately settled on a solution from Adobe that allowed us to maintain a consistent workflow while adding functionality during the content layout phase. As a result, more photos, videos and dynamic elements were being produced in concert with the print addition. We launched with mixed feedback and continued to iterate based on reader feedback.
